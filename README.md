This repo contains my solutions to programming exercises in the book
Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, by Sutton and Barto, 2nd Edition
(2018).

It also contains implementations of some RL algorithms presented in the book that are not required as exercises.

These scripts should only be considered as a reference. Use at your own risk.
